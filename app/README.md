# Chatapp (No name currently)

- This is the folder containing the source code for the Desktop/Web/Mobile builds of the app. Code is prototyped in GDscript and could later be easily converted to C# (which sadly does not support web builds, so it'll be decided later)

# How to build

## Using the CLI

- ```godot --headless --export-release "YourPlatform" /path/to/```

## Using the editor

- Install the export templates
- Build from the export window
